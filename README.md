# CEIS150-Advance-Course-Project
In this project I designed, coded, tested and documented business-oriented solutions using complex algorithms. Advanced topics include the use of libraries for data manipulation and visualization.

Object-oriented techniques were used to develop a stock tracking application. By processing the historical stock data, profit/loss reports can be generated. Data storage will allow users to save and retrieve stock data. An embedded database management system will allow users to save and retrieve stock data. The system will use the Python libraries to create charts and get historical stock data from web sites.
